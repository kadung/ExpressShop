---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The form is defined in HTML as a collection of elements inside <form>...</form> tags,
containing at least one input element of type="submit".

    <form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
        <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
        <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
        <input type="submit" value="OK">
    </form>

With:
    + action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is 
    submitted. If this is not set (or set to an empty string), then the form will be 
    submitted back to the current page URL.
    + method: The HTTP method used to send the data: POST or GET.
    + name, id: identify the field in JavaScript/CSS/HTML.
    + value: defines the initial value for the field when it is first displayed.
    + type="submit": is a button (by default)

    Form handling process
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A process flowchart for processing form requests:
    1. Display the form when it is requested by the user using GET request. The form may
    contain blank fields (ex: creating a new record), or it may be pre-populated with 
    initial values (ex: changing a record).
    
    2. Receive data submitted by the user, usually in an HTTP POST request.
    
    3. Validate and sanitize the data.
    
    4. If any data is invalid, re-display the formâ€”this time with any user populated 
    values and error messages for the problem fields.
    
    5. If all data is valid, perform required actions (ex: save the data in the database,
    send a notification email, return the result of a search, upload a file, etc.)
    
    6. Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.

- Express doesn't provide any specific support for form handling operations, but it can
use middleware to process POST and GET parameters from the form, and to validate or 
sanitize their values.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Validation and sanitization
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Before the data from a form is stored it must be validated and sanitized:
    + Validation checks that entered values are appropriate for each field (are in the
    right range, format, etc.) and that values have been supplied for all required fields.

    + Sanitization removes or replaces characters in the data that might potentially be 
    used to send malicious content to the server.

- We can use the popular express-validator module to perform both validation and 
sanitization of our form data.
